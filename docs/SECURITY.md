# Security Measures and Considerations for CodedPad

## Overview
CodedPad is designed with security in mind, focusing on client-side encryption and data protection. This document outlines the security measures implemented in the application and provides recommendations for users to enhance their security posture.

## Client-Side Encryption
- All notes are encrypted on the client side before being sent to the server. This ensures that sensitive data is never transmitted in plaintext.
- The Web Crypto API is utilized for encryption and decryption processes, providing a robust and secure method for handling cryptographic operations.

## Data Storage
- User data, including pads and sessions, is stored in JSON files. While this approach is simple and effective for development, it is recommended to migrate to a more secure database solution for production environments.
- Ensure that the JSON files are not publicly accessible and are stored in a secure location on the server.

## Authentication
- Currently, the application does not implement user accounts, which reduces the attack surface related to user authentication.
- Future versions may include optional account features, and it is recommended to implement strong password policies and multi-factor authentication.

## Secure Communication
- Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit. This protects against man-in-the-middle attacks and ensures that data exchanged between the client and server is secure.
- Regularly update SSL/TLS certificates to maintain secure connections.

## Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
- Implement measures to sanitize inputs and escape outputs to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

## Regular Security Audits
- Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and address potential security issues.
- Keep dependencies up to date and monitor for known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

## User Recommendations
- Users should choose strong, unique passphrases for encrypting their notes.
- Regularly back up encrypted notes to prevent data loss.

## Conclusion
Security is an ongoing process, and CodedPad is committed to continuously improving its security measures. Users are encouraged to stay informed about best practices and to take proactive steps to protect their data.
